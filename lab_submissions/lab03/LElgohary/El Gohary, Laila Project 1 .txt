Project 1 - Data Collection Overview


1. Write up a short piece about what is accessible through the api/web scraping:

I found it difficult to scrape a large enough dataset, or find one available for free in the field I was initially looking into (recipe compositions).

I ended up finding a fabulous dataset through opendata.nyc.gov that lists out every restaurant in the city, as well as their sanitation inspection rating.

In total the set is around 300K, with the following variables:
Unique Identifier
Name of Restaurant
Borough
Address
Cuisine Code
Inspection Date
Action	
Violation Code	
Score
Current Grade	
Grade Date
Record Date


2. Write a question of interest using these fields, and generate a hypothesis
Is there a correlation between cuisine type and the inspection result?
Are there any patterns that appear between the neighborhood a restaurant is located and the type of food it serves?

3. Given the data's current structure, what changes will you have to make to it?
The data is pretty clean, through I will import the cuisine types and map them to the code.
I will also look into gathering the lat/long info based on these addresses and append them so that I can create some maps.
