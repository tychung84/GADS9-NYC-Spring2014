David Lytz, I am developing an iPad-based analytics application for a global insurance services firm.

I started learning Turbo Pascal ~1996 and then messed around with VB 4.0 and Java a  bit as a hobby. I wrote a lot of SQL DDL and DML after college at my first job and am now learning Objective C. I took stats and advanced stats in college in a behavioral sciences context (psychology).

Sadly, I'm not on Facebook or Twitter.

I came across a David McCandless post but lost the link when I had to redo my git configuration...
