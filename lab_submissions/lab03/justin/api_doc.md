A: zillow.com - specializes in real estate data
B: several different APIs including home valuations, neighborhood data, and mortgages
C: Would like to see if i can compare the following for each neighborhood/zip in a given area:
	Houses sold in the last 1/3/6 months
	Houses currently for sale
	Average/median time on the market
	Price
	Price per sqr foot

The over all goal is to develop a tool to find the best areas to build a house if your intention is to then sell the house.
