Project

I think what I will do for my project is use the NYTimes Most Popular API and find out what news topics are the most popular.
I'm not sure what data can be extracted from this API yet. I believe it's a relatively new API.

I was going to use Retrosheet.org and find out if, in fact! (jk), Wrigley Field is jinxed or is it the Goat's curse.
(Small bit of Chicago Cubs lore.)
Retrosheet.org is great in that I can download 100's of years of data for free.
However, baseball is very complicated and I'm not sure I could ever answer my own question!
But I might be able to find out some interesting stats from it for the assignment.

Am I on the right track for what we're supposed to accomplish for this assignment? Any suggestions?
