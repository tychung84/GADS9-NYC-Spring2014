###Ideas for Final Project###

##### I will be attempting to create a report for my VP at work #####

The data is for the management of construction of our NYC schools.
The report will be issued to the VP monthly as a PDF.

3 main topics will be examined; (1) open change orders, (2) outstanding change order proposals, and (3) non-conformance reports.

(1) Open Change Orders (CO's) and the data around these is the main topic
	-to show by month the total number of open CO's
	-graphs of the count of open CO's by boro and district (on a map)
	-predict the total amount of co's by contract amount and completion date
	-predict the actual completion date versus original completion date by project amount and contractor
	-I would really like help in coming up with more to show here!

(2) Outstanding CO Proposals
	-create a graph for each contractor and their history of outstanding CO proposals
	-calculate the regression for each contractor
	-predict the number of outstanding pco's by contractor for next month
	
(3) Non-conformance reports
	-provide statistics on current resolution rates for non-conformance reports
