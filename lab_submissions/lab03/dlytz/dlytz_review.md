1. List

2. yellow_orange (a string)

3. 2 /5 = 0; float(2) / float(5) = 0.4

4. tweet is a dictionary (words + defintions)

5. datetime.datetime

6. print tweet['text']

7. sum(some_values) / len(some_values) = 99.9

8. def calc_list_avg(mylist):
	print sum(mylist) / len(mylist)

9. a * b = [[1 4 9], [16 25 36]]

10. a.dot(b) fails because the arrays do not have congruent dimensions, whereas a.dot(c) succeeds and b.dot(c) succeeds

11. np.dot(a, c) is the same as a.dot(c) to the extent that the matrix multiplication because we are mutliplying the same way

12. np.dot(a, c) is not the same as np.dot(c, a) because first we are multiplying a 2x3 * a 3x2 and secondly a 3x2 * a 2x3; different resulting shape
