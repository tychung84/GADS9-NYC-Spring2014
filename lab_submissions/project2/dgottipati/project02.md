For my second project I would like to work with images.

Couple of ideas I am considering.

1) I have a hard disk of images. An idea is to write a classifier to sort these out. At a high level assign 5 labels to the images - tell me if they are landscape, portraits, etc
2) A classifier that can compare two pictures and tell me if they are both more or less identical. That way I can clean out almost "duplicate" pictures.
3) A classifier that would tell me if an image is an advertisement or not. A way to recognize banner ads.
4)  And then I thought it could just be fun to do this instagram engg challenge of an un-shredder.

I am leaning toward (4)

I looked up some sample projects on imaging and some of them use PCA to breakdown the complexity of dealing with RGB's. 

I just installed PIL/Pillow Python libraries and I am learning the functions that I can use in the module. At this point, I dont really have a full understanding of how complex or simple the above projects are as I have not explored the libray enough to understand. I would like to do this iteratively (with the constraints of time etc) and build up toward the final project. 

I appreciate some direction on which one to tackle first.
