99.9

sum(some_values)
sum(some_values)/len(some_values)
round(sum(some_values)/len(some_values),2)


8. write a function that takes a list as an argument and returns back the average of that list.
Use the following code to work through problems 9-12

def mean(x):
	return sum(x)/ len(x)

mean (some_values)



9. What happens if you do a * b? Check the help function of np.dot(). (run help(np.dot()))
The matrices are multiplied together (i.e 1*1, 2*2,...)

10. Why does a.dot(b) fail? Why does a.dot(c) work?
a.dot fails because it is not aligned, whereas a.dot(c) is.


11. Is np.dot(a, c) the same as a.dot(c)? Why or why not?
Yes

12. Is np.dot(a, c) the same as np.dot(c, a)? Why or why not?
