__a. A quick explanation of the website you're working from (or where the data comes from)__

I'll be getting data from the World Bank API which has economic and developmental data for different
regions and countries.

__b. A description of what's available (either api, scraping, or some other service)__


From site: "access to the following list of databases: World Development Indicators, Global Development Finance, African development Indicators, Doing Business, Enterprise Surveys, Millennium Development Goals, Education Statistics, Gender Statistics, Health and Nutrition Statistics, IDA Results Measurement System"

__c. An explanation of what you want to investigate with some basic stats and plotting__

look through documentation for educational data and see if there is any leading correlation between
some education metric and economic growth/development. This will be more fleshed out soon as I get a
better chance to experiment with what I can pull and what it looks like.
