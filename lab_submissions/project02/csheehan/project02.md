--Review instructions for Project 2-- 
An idea of the dataset you'd like to look at: 

I am going to use the same dataset I scraped for Project 1, NCAA men's basketball box scores for the 2013-14 season, (hopefully) with the addition of missing data from 1/18/2014 that was omitted from Project 1 because it repeatedly crashed my scraper. 


The category or categories you'd like to predict: 

I am assigning each of the XX Di- 1 conferences into one of two commonly accepted categories: Major and Mid-Major.
Major: (ACC, Big 10, Big 12, Pac-12, and SEC). I'd like to predict a player's conference category based on their height, school year and box scores stats (minutes, points, rebounds, assists) throughout the season.
