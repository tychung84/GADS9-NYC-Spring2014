a. I would like to collect tweet data from Twitter
b. Twitter has an API available
c. I would like to investigate whether you can determine the point in time of a spoiler in a TV (e.g., Game of Thrones) based on hastags/words found in each tweet and number of tweets per second

As an alternative, I was looking into:
a. collecting published patent application and issued patent data from the US Patent and Trademark Office
b. Unfortunately, the USPTO does not appear to have an API, so some form of scraping will likely be necessary
c. determining the most frequently used terms in applications and issued patents and attempting to categorize the words to a specific technology (e.g., 3D TVs)
