1) a* b => will multiply each element of array a by each corresponding 
elemetn of array b 

2) This fails because the dot product requires complimentary matrix dimensions.
For example : a (2 x 3) . (3 x 2) matrix does work, because the column dim of the 1st mat 
is equal to the row dim. of the 2nd matrix.

3) yes: the arrays are the same: the entries and 2 different
ways of structuring the same thing (where the 1st utilizes numpy)

4) no. Matrix a.c is not equal to matrix c.a : (one will 
result in a 2 x 2 matirx, and the other will be 3 x 3
