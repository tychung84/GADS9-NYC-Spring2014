Submit your API doc overview. This has:


a) A quick explanation of the website you're working from (or where the data comes from)
For now, I am looking at the Hacker News website.
I am also playing with a travel forum indiamike.com (and will add this in if I can complete by next week)

The hacker new website shows the articles on deeply interesting stuff.
The website shows via ranking the most popular links.
For each link/article the source, the source of the article on one line.
And below each article it gives the points received by the last user, the last user name
of the user who voted on it, the time since the last vote and the total overall comments for the article.

b) A description of what's available (either api, scraping, or some other service)
The hacker news website can be scraped using Beautiful Soup.
I wrote some sample code to pull the data and it works.
The website can also be scraped using Kimono labs API, which I might use for
easy pagination.

c) An explanation of what you want to investigate with some basic stats and plotting

Some questions that can be investigated
1. How many of the articles are tech related?
>> Not sure how I can comb for this though, unless I have a repository of all tech related words?
2. How long does and article stay in the top 5?
3. How many comments on average do the articles get?
4. Which sources seem to contribute the most to the news articles?
5. Which user contributed to the most articles?
6. Which user posted the most comments?
