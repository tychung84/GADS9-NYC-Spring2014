Ariba Jahan

I used to be the Head of Operations at a startup. I left that so that I could focus on learning.  I am currently taking classes: Product Management and Data Science at the GA. 

My background is in Bioengineering, so I took Linear Algenbra, Differential Equations and Statics/Mechanics Math. Programming wise- I taught myself MATLAb, introductory level.
