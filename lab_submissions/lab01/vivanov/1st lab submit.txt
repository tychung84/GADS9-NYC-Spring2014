Hi, my name is Victor Ivanov and I’m a senior biz analyst for Reference Data at RBC CM.

My coding background is non-existent (if you count writing queries in Showcase as coding, that’s it) and my math background is “some college” with no heavy use in subsequent years.

I currently don’t read any data blogs, so nothing to post. I believe this will all change shortly…
