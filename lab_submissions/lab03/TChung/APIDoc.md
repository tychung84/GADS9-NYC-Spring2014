Proposal:

I have been looking at the citibike dataset, which gives extensive information regarding when the bikes have been used, from departure to arrival. All of this data is available via csvs, which makes it very convenient to study. I would like to look into trends in the bike usage, coninsiding with the weather data and the time (provided through the national data service). In other words, people will use the bikes in bad weather if there are no other good means of transportation, indicating potential places for bus stops and etc. to start.
