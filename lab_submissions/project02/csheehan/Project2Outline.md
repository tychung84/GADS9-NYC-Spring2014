--Review instructions for Project 2-- 
An idea of the dataset you'd like to look at: 

I am going to use the same dataset I scraped for Project 1, NCAA men's basketball box scores for the 2013-14 season, (hopefully) with the addition of missing data from 1/18/2014 that was omitted from Project 1 because it repeatedly crashed my scraper. 


The category or categories you'd like to predict: 

I'd like to predict a player's conference based on their height, year and box scores stats (minutes, points, rebounds, assists) throughout the season. Alternatively, I might try to predict players' box score stats (points and/or rebounds per game) based on their heights and conference affiliation.


# Should I classify conferences as major/mid/small in order to decrease classification options? Just major/small so binary?

##How do you find the break point for separating continuous data into (binary) classifications?
