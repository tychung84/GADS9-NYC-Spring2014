Beer is fun and it's also big business.

I've been looking on the web for different data options and I think
that 'http://www.beerinstitute.org' provides a great resource.

I was able to download an Excel file with dozens of tabs breaking
down the beer industry over different years, geographical locations,
etc. 

Technically not an API, please let me know if this goes against the
spirit of the assignment; I have other candidate sites to scrape 
from.

I will have uploaded the Excel file for review, file name:

Brewers_Almanac-_20131.xlsx

There is a wealth of information here; some of the things that may
be plotted:

	* states becoming drier over time
	* states becoming wetter over time
	* NY v. NJ comparison
	
I'd like to fool around with the data a bit and see what stands out
and would be most interesting for class presentation.
