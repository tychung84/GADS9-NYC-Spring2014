###Ideas for Project 2###

##### I will be continuing with the [Retrosheet](http://retrosheet.org) regular season game data dataset. #####

Not to disprove the Wrigley Field Curse (jk) but to learn about baseball and compare other teams to the Cubs. Specifically, I will focus on 2 aspects to this data; the first is Attendance, the second is the Cubs.

1.	Attendance
		This is to analyze regular season game data as if from a marketing perspective. 
		-predict Attendance based on opponent and day of the week and month
		-predict Attendance based on win/loss record of previous games
		 		 
2.	Cubs
		-predict the total number of runs in a game based on the opponent and date
		-predict the Cubs win/loss ratio at the end of 2013 season
		-answer, what's the probability of the Cubs winning or losing a specific game
		-list what might be the top 5 or 10 teams of the 2013 season
