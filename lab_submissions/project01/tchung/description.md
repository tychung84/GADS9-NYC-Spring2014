General Overview:

I have looked into citibike data, specifically looking into the general trends of writers, especially commuters. This data was compiled using a combination of citibike data from the citibike website, weather data from the NOAA, and subway data from the open data sources given by NYC. Using this data, I have created four charts plotting the relationship between weather and a commuter/tourist use of the bike, as well as the relationship between ridership and the distance from a subway.
