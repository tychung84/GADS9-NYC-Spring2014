For my project, I will be scraping from the Healthcare.gov website.


The site comes with an Api.  I hope to use this. 
(depending on how well it works) - otherwise, I will use beautifulsoup


My goal is to acquire a breakdown of participation by state. 
And study the correlation between state color (blue/red) and state participation.
